        <p>Innovative technologies are being developed to address the growing problem of ocean pollution. Some of these include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ocean Cleanup Projects</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Biodegradable Alternatives</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Innovative technologies are tackling plastic pollution through ocean cleanup projects and biodegradable alternatives. The Ocean Cleanup Project uses autonomous barriers to remove plastic from the ocean, while initiatives like the Seabin Project and 4Ocean Cleanup focus on collecting waste from waterways. Meanwhile, biodegradable alternatives such as PLA and PHA plastics, mushroom-based packaging, and seaweed-derived bioplastics offer sustainable solutions to replace traditional plastic. These advancements help reduce pollution, protect marine life, and promote a greener future by encouraging eco-friendly materials and large-scale cleanup efforts.</p>

        <h2>Global Efforts for Ocean Conservation</h2>
        <p>International organizations and governments are working together to protect and preserve our oceans. Key efforts include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>UN's Sustainable Development Goal 14:</strong> This goal focuses on conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas, and marine resources. It includes targets to reduce marine pollution and protect marine ecosystems. The UN encourages countries to implement policies that promote ocean health.</li>
            <li><strong>Marine Protected Areas (MPAs):</strong> Establishing MPAs to safeguard critical habitats and biodiversity, ensuring sustainable use of marine resources. These areas help to preserve the natural balance of marine ecosystems and provide a refuge for endangered species.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Collaborative efforts on a global scale are essential to address the challenges facing our oceans. By working together, we can create a more sustainable future for marine environments.</p>
