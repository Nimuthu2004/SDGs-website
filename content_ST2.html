        <h1>Threats to Ocean Ecosystems</h1>
        <p>The oceans, which cover over 70% of the Earth's surface, play a pivotal role in maintaining the planetâ€™s ecological balance. These vast ecosystems support a wide array of marine life, regulate global climate patterns, and sustain the livelihoods of millions of people worldwide. However, human activities are increasingly jeopardizing these essential ecosystems. The major threats include plastic pollution, overfishing, coral bleaching, and the broad impacts of climate change.</p>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Plastic Pollution</h2>
            <img src="images/Plasticpollutionintheocean.jpg" alt="Plastic pollution in the ocean">
            <p>Each year, an estimated 8 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the oceans, posing a severe threat to marine life and ecosystems. Marine animals often mistake plastic debris for food, leading to ingestion, injury, and death. A tragic example of this was the discovery of a pilot whale in Thailand in 2018, which had 80 plastic bags in its stomach.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Overfishing</h2>
            <img src="images/Fishingboatsoverfishingtheocean.jpg" alt="Fishing boats overfishing the ocean">
            <p>Overfishing is a significant contributor to the depletion of marine fish populations across the globe. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), approximately 34% of global fish stocks are currently overexploited. This unsustainable practice disrupts marine food chains, threatens biodiversity, and undermines the economic stability of communities that depend on fishing industries.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Coral Bleaching</h2>
            <img src="images/Coralreefaffectedbybleaching.jpg" alt="Coral reef affected by bleaching">
            <p>Rising sea temperatures, driven by climate change, have led to widespread coral bleaching events. During such events, corals expel the algae that provide them with vital nutrients, resulting in the degradation of reefs. For example, the Great Barrier Reef suffered severe bleaching in 2016 and 2017, with approximately two-thirds of its corals affected.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Climate Change</h2>
            <img src="images/Effectsofclimatechangeontheocean.jpg" alt="Effects of climate change on the ocean">
            <p>Climate change is a primary driver of ocean warming, acidification, and rising sea levels, all of which have profound effects on marine ecosystems. The Arctic, for instance, has warmed nearly four times faster than the global average over the past three decades, leading to significant reductions in sea ice and threatening species such as polar bears and seals.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p class="section" style="background-color: #b6cfe9;">
            Addressing these urgent challenges requires global collaboration, the adoption of sustainable practices, and a strong commitment to safeguarding the health of our oceans for future generations. The time to act is now, before these critical ecosystems face irreversible damage.</p>
